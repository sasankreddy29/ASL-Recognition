# ASL-Recognition
American Sign Language (ASL) is a natural, visual language used by many deaf and hard of hearing people. By integrating sophisticated computer vision and machine learning techniques, it enables real-time interpretation of ASL gestures. By simply observing ASL signs, the system promptly translates them into written or spoken language, enhancing accessibility and providing an intuitive and efficient means for immediate communication between deaf and hearing individuals. The proposed model is a significant advancement in bridging communication gaps and fostering inclusivity in diverse social scenarios. Furthermore, the camera-centric paradigm ensures dynamic adaptability, making it suitable for users of varying proficiency levels. The system's precision in translating ASL gestures into comprehensible language promotes clarity and understanding, adding a layer of efficiency to communication. The proposed model is a testament to the intersection of cutting- edge technology and accessibility, offering a transformative approach to inclusivity in communication for the deaf community and beyond.
